# Heureka.cz URL Parser

### https://vlastapolach.github.io/JS-parser/

## 1) When do you want to use this?
For marketing/sales activities you can download a list of Czech e-shops. E-shops can are divided into different categories and from each category, there are shown max. 300 e-shops (so you need to go deeper to inner categories to get more results).

## 2) Download Chrome Plugin
For security reasons, you can't browse other URLs source code (Access-Control-Allow-Origin). You have to use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and download and **enable** this plugin: **[Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi)**. Before new run, it is recommended to **Deactivate** and then **Active** the A-C-A-O* plugin and refresh the page.

## 3) Paste the URL of category
Insert only part with category name (without beginning and end slashes) - https://obchody.heureka.cz/ **auto-moto** /

If empty, Parser will search on main page https://obchody.heureka.cz/

## 4) Click Proceed
Progress will be shown in Console log window.

## 5) Download CSV
Based on the number of URLs and connection speed, searching might take a while. The Download button will become active after the searching is done.
